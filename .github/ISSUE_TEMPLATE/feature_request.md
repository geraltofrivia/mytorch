**Description**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. There's this paper which claims that if you schedule your learning rate to follow a death spiral through seven stages of hell, you end up with a major performance boost across multiple tasks. Can you implement it?

**[OPTIONAL] Where can the implementation be plugged in**
Does this _feature_ require major overhauls in the code structure? Where can I put this in?

**[OPTIONAL] Existing Implementations**
I'm not a particularly bright (or confident) programmer and would fare much better with example codes.
